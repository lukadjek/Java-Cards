SPECIFICATION

Short description: This software is useful for anyone who is willing to test their knowledge in an interesting, fun and proactive way. It can be used for students to quickly check up on their subject before any oral exam by getting a question, answering by-heart, getting next question and so on until there's no more questions! Of course, all questions and their appropriate answers are created by the user.

Available options for "BUILDER" gui:
1. add one question, add one answer, save it one card, continue
2. checks and help added: 
    * a) question area cannot be empty
    * b) answer area cannot be empty
    * c) it is not allowed to have two same questions in the set (there cannot be two same cards)
    * d) keyboard key "enter" can be used to quickly jump in this order: question -> answer -> "save this card" button
    * e) focus will always be there where you'll need it. In other words, focus is requested:
        * e.1) to the question area if "save this card" button is pressed and question area is empty
        * e.2) to the question area if "save this card" button is pressed and the question already exists
        * e.3) to the answer area if "save this card" button is pressed and answer area is empty
    * f) each press on the "save this card" button creates a new empty card with a random color (provided there are no                errors)
    * g) appropriate information message is shown to the user so that he/she knows exactly the current status of the                  software (this includes all error messages, warning messages and success messages)
    * h) when exiting this gui, the software checks whether the user saved all cards in the set or not
    * i) in case the user saved a card with a wrong question/answer, he/she can use the "new" menu option to delete all              cards and start over
    * j) shortcut to open this menu option: CTRL + 8
